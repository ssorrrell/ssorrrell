## About

Sr Web Developer starting with Classic ASP and VB6 in 1999 and progressing up thru .Net Framework 1.1 and c#, ASP.NET, Silverlight with MVC, AngularJS with MVC, Angular with MVC, and Angular with Microservices.  My first 6 years were spent developing an internal engineering document management application.  Then I joined CSStars working on a enterprise class risk management information system (RMIS) SaaS product.  I currently work for CCMSI developing an internal claims management application UI in the latest version of Angular using Kendo controls and microservice backend.

My interest is in programming to produce a useful product.  To that end I have accumulated many skills; Agile Methodologies, performance analysis, SCRUM, team leadership/management, deconstructing requirements into workable pieces, project management, complex excel formulas, and more.  My focus is on good programming practice leading to maintainable, long-lived, flexible solutions.

This github contains some sample projects and a number of things under construction.  After my second job I realized all the examples of my skills were in proprietary code bases not available to the general public.  I'd much rather discuss concrete examples and demonstrate something than solve on-the-spot challenges or take tests.

My first computer was a Color Computer 3.  The community is still active.  I though it looked fun to make a modern IDE work with an original 8-bit language from 40 years ago.  I also wonder about using the Color Computers as a platform to teach programming as there are a number of emulators, the machines can be sandboxed easily, the number of keywords are minimal, and they were designed for people with absolutely no experience.

The big focus now is the VS Code extension and related repos for making it easy to develop for the Color Computer 3. This consists of a Antrl4 parser generator, subsequent Parser and validation unit tests, a Language Server that calls the parser, and the VS Code extension that connects VS Code the language server/parser.  The extension is written in typescript.  The remaining repos are in c#.  They can be used independently or together.  A Color Basic parser could be used to make a cruncher/compressor or virtual machine.  The Language Server is IDE agnostic and could be used to make an ATOM or neoVIM extension.

The Weather App is a Xamarin front end with a Server backend to obtain NWS weather info this Texas Panhandle region.  It's probably about 30% complete.
